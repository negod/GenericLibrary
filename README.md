GenericLibrary
==============

A library for handling generics (Dto, Xml creation and so on) All generic and cool!

- Generic Dto that acts as a field holder. Just add an enum and you can use it as a DTO/Class with getters and setters
- Use the generic DTO to create and read XML files - (For now it always creates a new file, support will be available to uadate a file)
